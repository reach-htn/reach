Internet access via SMS - Hack the North 2019

Our service seeks to provide Internet access to users across the world who may not have the luxury of a data point in the form of WiFi, 3G, LTE, etc. Through sending an SMS, our automated program will retrieve the specific information you are searching for and display it in text form that is easily consumable and does not require a fast connection speed. For example, someone could text simply "Directions from Nanjing to Beijing" and our automated servers hosted on the Firebase cloud will send them the step-by-step instructions. Additional features include geographic information, such as local news and weather. We hope to reach out to people across the globe and provide convenience to everyone's daily lives.
